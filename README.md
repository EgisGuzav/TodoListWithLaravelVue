<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<p>
	As the description of the repository says, this is a small project that I've made following the basic structure of
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=UHSipe7pSac&ab_channel=Scrypster">this video</a> by the user Youtube
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1_G0EoEIb87wi3GPlk-CQ">Scrypster</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The original creator makes the application in Vue 2 and Laravel 8, whereas I've made it in Vue 3 and Laravel 9.
	I've also made use of Bootstrap 5 to give some basic yet elegant style to the elements.
</p>

<p>
	There are some changes that I consider as an improvement over the original project (aside from the design), 
	such as the following:
	<ul> 
		<li>Checking the checkbox if the task has already been completed when getting the items through the API.</li> 
		<li>
			Including translations declared in the files located at the 'lang' folder. This has been possible thanks to the
			<a href="https://github.com/kg-bot/laravel-localization-to-vue">Laravel localization to Vue</a> 
			package.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cleaner organization of the <code>resources/js</code> directory along with renaming many of the <code>.js</code> and <code>.vue</code> files to ensure a cohesive and simplestructure.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<!-- BUILT WITH -->

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

-   [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)
-   [Laravel 9](https://laravel.com)
-   [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To make the project work on your PC, you have to create a <code>.env</code> file and specify there the 
credentials of the DB that you'll have to create in order to make CRUD operations with the tasks. Other than
that, the project is pretty much settled to be executed. 

Don't forget to use Apache Server (or such as the likes of it) to host it and to run the <code>npm run watch</code>
command to compile the changes that you apply.

<!-- SETTING UP VUE 3 AND BOOTSTRAP 5 -->

## Setting up Vue 3 and Bootstrap 5

Even though these frameworks are included in the project without the need of doing anything else, I'll show yo how to get Vue 3 and Bootstrap 5 working on Laravel 9, regardless of the nature of the project.

<!-- INSTALLATION OF VUE 3 -->
### Installation of Vue 3

<ol>
	<li>
		We need to install npm in our project by executing the following command in the root of the project:
			```sh
			npm install
			```
	</li>
	<li>
		Once npm has been installed, we need to install Vue by executing of this command: 
		```sh
			npm install vue ^3.0.0
		```
	</li>
</ol>

<!-- SETTING UP VUE 3 IN THE PROJECT -->
### Setting up Vue 3 in the project

Now that Vue is downloaded into the project, we need to add <code>.vue()</code> to <code>mix.js("resources/js/app.js", "public/js")</code> in the <code>webpack.mix.js</code> file in order to pass options to configure global styles and Vue component style extraction in Laravel.

<!-- INSTALLATION OF VUE 5 -->
### Installation of Bootstrap 5

<ol>
	<li>
		In case that you haven't downloaded npm yet, you'll have to execute the following command in the root of the project:
			```sh
			npm install
			```
	</li>
	<li>
		Once npm has been installed, we need to install Bootstrap by executing. 
		```sh
			npm install bootstrap
		```
	</li>
	<li>
		We'll also have to install SASS and SASS loader in our project because Bootstrap makes use of this preprocessor of CSS.
		```sh
			npm install sass
		```
		Once it has finished with the installation, we need to install the SASS processor to convert the code to CSS.
		```sh
			npm install sass-loader
		```
	</li>
</ol>

<!-- SETTING UP BOOTSTRAP 5 IN THE PROJECT -->
### Setting up Bootstrap 5 in the project

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			In case that <code>resources/sass/app.scss</code> is not present in the project, we need to create the <code>sass</code>
			directory inside the <code>resources</code> directory. Then, we'll create the <code>app.css</code> file in order to add
			the line <code>@import '~bootstrap';</code>. 
		</p>
		<p>
		  By the way, just a thought aside: the <code>bootstraping</code> directory of the root of any Laravel project has nothing to do with the CSS library. As the Stackoverflow user <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/205528/kien-truong">kien-truong</a> points out on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23902038/15675885">this answer</a>, it's used to initialize (setting up path and environments) the framework. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Having done that, now we have to append <code>.sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')</code> to the <code>mix</code> to let Laravel know that the compiled version of the SASS styles have to be compiled into the <code>public/css</code> directory.
	</li>
	<li>Now we can compile the project to generate the CSS file in the <code>public/css</code> directory that we just set up by executing <code>npm run dev</code>.</li>
	<li>
		If you have followed all the steps correctly, now you only have to add <code>&lt;link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
	</code> (or <code>mix('css/app.css')</code>, depending of your purpose) to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the Blade templates.</li>
</ol>
